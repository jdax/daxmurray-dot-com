  description: "After realizing their dream of being a curmudgeonly hedgewitch in the woods of Western Pennsylvania was not possible due to the construction of a Dave & Busters, Dax took up a new form of sorcery, where they whispered to rocks in arcane languages and taught them how to spy on you, colloquially known as software engineering. <br/><br/>After an epic battle between the forces of Ethics and Student Loan Payments, Dax left that behind to join the magical order of word-placing. Today, they can be found waiting on the two gods (ie: cats) who have allowed them to live in their abode and use their word-magic to make others cry. <br/><br/>Dax studied political science and creative writing at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania and is a member of the Editorial Freelancers Association. When not writing, they can be found at the Crystarium in Norvrandt.<br/><br/>If you are interested in the <i>Scions and Shadows</i> series, the best place to find all of the  books plus the plethora of bonus content is on <a href='http://scions.daxmurray.com'>Campfire,</a> a unique reader experience with tons of modules for characters, maps, location and lore pages, and more.
