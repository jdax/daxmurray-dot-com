  description: "What are beta readers? They are the heroes who let authors know what works, what doesn't work, and, most importantly, tell us if the dragons we've conjured in Chapter Four are as fearsome as we want them to be.<br/><br/>Beta readers get access to the books early in the process, often before the book has gone through a ton of editing. They provide feedback on the story and offer advice for making the story stronger. <br/><br/>If you are interested in joining my beta team, please fill out the form below."

  description: "What is this elusive entity, the ARC team, you ask? Imagine being the chosen ones, the keepers of secrets before the world beholds the magic. ARC, or Advanced Reader Copy, is your ticket to the sacred chamber where unpublished manuscripts await your discerning eyes. You, an honored guest at the birth of a fantastical saga, witnessing the narrative unfold before the rest of the world even dreams of it. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to read, immerse, and become one with the story, and leave reviews whereever you please. Members of the ARC team get access to the book immediately before publication. They get final, polished books. ARC readers leave reviews on all platforms they can on the day of publication or shortly thereafter. If you would like to be a part of my ARC team, apply below."
