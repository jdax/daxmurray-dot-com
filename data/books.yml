  review: 
    review_text: "A complex story about grief and trying to find both agency in one's life and what one wants out of it, Stars and Soil has a large, diverse cast of characters - some charming, some despicable, but all complex and real. Tons of description paints vivid pictures that really draw you into the environment and the story, and the intrigue will leave you second-guessing everyone's motives as the events of the present eerily echo events of the past that refuse to let go."
    review_author: "~ Liz Sauco, <a href='https://www.lizsauco.com/'> Author of the Blades of the Goddess</a>"
  review_two:
    review_text: "Stars and Soil hits the ground running with the introduction of Caitlin, a woman coming to terms with everything that’s happened to her while simultaneously navigating her moral proclivities in a society filled with pirates, religious zealots, and the ever-shifting world mercantile business. She comes to odds with her own family, battling frustrations she buried in her heart for years, the anger and isolation of being uprooted, and the resentment towards having others direct her life. Dax has a very emotionally convincing main character, making her journey through her fantastical world all the more engaging. I look forward to seeing the rest of Caitlin’s journey."

  intro_hook: "Can the villainess solve the mystery before the heroine sends her to the gallows?"
  main_description: "<p>For Lady Eirnín Brolcháin, the echoes of a vanquished royal lineage cling to her every move. As the last scion of the once-revered family, the value of her hand in marriage transcends mere alliances—it symbolizes the tenuous bridge between the old and the new. Yet, Eirnín, known as Ein, harbors a quest far removed from the intrigues of the court. Haunted by mysterious fainting spells and nightmares, she delves into the enigma that shrouds her existence during the day and finds her escape in fiction at night. When her betrothal to the third prince crumbles in favor of a foreign commoner, Ein is thrust into a labyrinth of concealed truths and intricate conspiracies. Betrothal had come with the promise of access to the finest physicians to treat her illness, she now treads the unknown, seeking solace in the arts of witches. </p><p>Finnian Mac Iomaire, the youngest scion of the current ruler, grapples with a kingdom held by a shaky grasp on a stolen throne. Unperturbed by his father's unease, Finnian discovers an unexpected anchor in his past. A chance incident at his grandmother's funeral unlocks memories of a former life—a life entwined with a video game strangely mirroring the fantastical realm he now inhabits. His only cause for concern? Ein, or Lady Eirnín Brolcháin. In the virtual game, she was a character of ice, cruelty, and conspiracies against Ciara, the game's heroine. Yet, reality unveils a different narrative, as Ein extends an unexpected warmth towards him. So warm, in fact, that she proposes the unimaginable: marriage. But for Finnian, love is a forbidden territory.
