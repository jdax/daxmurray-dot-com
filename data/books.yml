To hear metal singing, some of it waiting just beneath the surface, so much of it deeper in the earth. If they wanted, the knew they could pluck that metal from the earth, melt it with a thought, and shape it as they pleased with a breath of air and their will.</p> <p>Each Ástfríður must choose which metal they would wear upon their heads, denoting the path they would walk. They craft beautiful horns to wear on their brow, forged with the metal they wish to identify with. But Britt does not know if they can choose the path they want, if they can overcome a past which has stolen their identity. The day has come for them to choose and they have no idea if they have any right to even try to. And Astrid has never felt the pull of the metal at all Wearing a forged circlet and horn, they try to navigate a world that they feel has rejected them, all the while fearing someone will learn their secret."

  review: 
    review_text: "A complex story about grief and trying to find both agency in one's life and what one wants out of it, Stars and Soil has a large, diverse cast of characters - some charming, some despicable, but all complex and real. Tons of description paints vivid pictures that really draw you into the environment and the story, and the intrigue will leave you second-guessing everyone's motives as the events of the present eerily echo events of the past that refuse to let go."
    review_author: "~ Liz Sauco, <a href='https://www.lizsauco.com/'> Author of the Blades of the Goddess</a>"
  review_two:
    review_text: "Stars and Soil hits the ground running with the introduction of Caitlin, a woman coming to terms with everything that’s happened to her while simultaneously navigating her moral proclivities in a society filled with pirates, religious zealots, and the ever-shifting world mercantile business. She comes to odds with her own family, battling frustrations she buried in her heart for years, the anger and isolation of being uprooted, and the resentment towards having others direct her life. Dax has a very emotionally convincing main character, making her journey through her fantastical world all the more engaging. I look forward to seeing the rest of Caitlin’s journey."

What was once a symbiotic cycle of life and death becomes a game of broken hearts and promises betrayed.

  intro_hook: "A reckless attempt to avoid a bad end; a determination to rewrite the story."
  main_description: "<p>The calculating villainess and the icy romanceable option must work together to avoid their Bad Ends.</p><p> As the last scion of the former royal family, Lady Eirnín Brolcְháin knows that the value of her hand in marriage transcends mere alliances—it symbolizes the tenuous bridge between the old and the new. Yet Ein desires something that no royal prince could ever offer her; an panacea for the nightmares that haunt her every night and a cure for her mysterious illness. When her arranged betrothal to the third prince, Lochlann Mac Iomaire, crumbles and he discards her in favor of foreign commoner, Ein is--at first--relieved. But as her health deteriorates and the nightmares become more real, she can no longer see the royal physicians and is caught in a web of conspiracies as she seeks answers from witches and forbidden magic users.</p><p>Finnian Mac Iomaire, the fourth prince of the still unsteady and untested Mac Iomaire dynasty, grapples with the responsibilities that come with helping to establish a new royal family on a stolen throne. He has spent his life knowing that something about him is different, but he could never put the feelings into words. That is, until an accident at his grandmother's funeral brings back his memories of his previous life—a life where he enjoyed a video game that is eerily similar to the life he finds himself now living, a life where he was very happily a woman. Suddenly, he has not only answers, but too many questions. </p><p>In the video game, he meets a deadly end when Lady Ein carries out her sinister plot to exact her revenge on Prince Lochlann for spurning her. Finnian is determined to avoid that, carefully manipulating events around him to ensure that the game follows a path where he knows he will survive. Yet, the Ein in this reality is not the cruel, and calculating villainess Finnian has feared. When she approaches him with a marriage proposal, he has to reevaluate all of his carefully laid plans and guard his heart and his secrets. </p>"
