December I plan on writing another 36k or more and finishing up the first draft of Smoke and Steel! It's had a few tweaks and changes to the storyline as I've drafted, and am feeling even more confident in it as the final month of 2023 starts! I got pretty sick at the end of November with some virus, but I still managed to crank out most of the first 3rd of the novel, so I am still proud even if my progress petered out.</p></div>

   <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2"><p>Like all good novelists, I <i>mostly</i> have set <i>Smoke and Steel</i> down since I finished writing the first draft (roughly 90k words!). I have been doing some light editing on what's there, primarily I've gone back to find names and words for things that didn't have them. One of the main character's during drafting didn't have a name. I just called her THE SMITH. Now she is Miramis. I've got a few alpha readers I wanted to get this to super quick, so needed to make sure places, important objects, and people had names. My revisions start in earnest on the 15th of January, and I'll be doing my reverse outlining process and taking diligent notes of what needs to be reworked. I've already got one major thing I know will be getting changes, and I am so excited for that. The first two weeks of January I will be outlining Shackles and Secrets and working on my ~~ <a href="https://blog.daxmurray.com/membership-on-ream-stories">secret project novel</a> ~~. #OopsIWroteAnotherNovel </p></div>
